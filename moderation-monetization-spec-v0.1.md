# moderation monetization spec v0.1

moderation is where the value is provided

moderation is a full-time activity for the birth of a healthy community

moderators set the culture

moderating requires commitment

### Starting channels:

Free channels start with default democratic rulesets

Paid channels \(per sq feet\) require monthly payment by initial creator, who is the first dictator of the channel

As channel turns increasingly democratic, the payment shifts to the collective: i.e. $5 needs to be pooled by the 100+ members every month. the founder is paid pack what they put in \(plus maybe a bit more\) from this pool, and the rest goes into funding the product

The founder payment pool can also be democratically shifted away to active moderators, as a way to reward moderators for good work.

Payment models can make use of channel rule algorithms to fine-tune the model on a case-by-case basis. For example, the users could choose to direct 20% of the gains equally to all users who have a "ranger" status, which is denoted by a set of rules i.e. "must have been a moderator for at least 1 month, with at most 20% of their decisions being vetoed". Vetoes can further have custom rules, i.e. "if 30% of moderators disagree, or if 60% of the channel members disagree, revert the moderator action"
