# Snippets / Reference

#### Roles

Roles are specific powers given to people by any form of authority. This can be hand-picked or voted on.

Most basic online example would be forum moderators. In the government, it can be a police officer, minister, mayor, etc. In a corporation, it could be a manager or VP etc.

#### Reputation

Reputation is almost synonomous with KYC \(know-your-customer\).

On online forums, it might come in the form of a score \(e.g. Karma on reddit\), or even sign-up date, which both act as proofs-of-participation in the community to varying degrees.

When we use Facebook or Google Login on a website, the website chooses to trust anyone that Facebook or Google already trusts, given their extensive anti-spam efforts. This is also a form of reputation: "I trust Joe because I trust Google and Google trusts Joe".
